<td>The content does not provide specific information on whether the license plate stays with the seller or is transferred to the buyer when the vehicle is sold in West Virginia. The details mostly revolve around titling a new vehicle, certificate of origin, new and used vehicle purchases, ATV's, gift transactions, trade-ins, titles and liens, lost/duplicate titles, and the procedure when a registrant dies. Overall, it focuses on the vehicle title rather than the license plates. Therefore, the policy regarding license plate transfer during vehicle sales remains uncertain based on the provided information.</td>
